## StarLoader
StarLoader is both the Mod Loader and Modding API for StarMade. While it originally started out as a separate project, it has since
been folded into the base game, meaning you don't have to do any separate installation steps. Additionally, you do not have to
manually download mods when joining a modded server - missing mods are automatically downloaded onto your client when joining.

You can also download and enable mods marked as **Client-Side** onto your game, and these should function even if the server you are
joining doesn't have the mod installed.

Just as you can download Blueprints and Templates from SMD in the Main Menu, you can also download mods this way too. Note that 
any mods uploaded to SMD have to be approved by a moderator first in order to be downloadable.

**Disclaimer: While there is moderation done on SMD, Schine is NOT responsible for developing or maintaing these mods. These 
mods are made by community members, and as such, it is on the end-user to be diligent and not download mods from shady sources.**
